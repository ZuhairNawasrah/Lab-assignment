        <p style="text-align: justify; ">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web.
            Itdefines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to
            describe a web page's appearance / presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). "Hypertext"
            refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between
            websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
            pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #DFB6E1;">CSS</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the
            presentation of a document written
            in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be
            rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is among the core languages of the open web
            and is standardized across Web
            browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was
            done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1,
            CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.</p>
